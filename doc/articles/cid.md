# Content ID

A [Cid](xref:Ipfs.Cid) is a self-describing content-addressed identifier for distributed systems. It doesn't indicate *where* 
the content is stored, but it forms a kind of address based on the content itself. 

For background information, see [cid concept](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/cid/).
