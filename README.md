# net-ipfs-core

The core objects of the [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) (Inter Planetary File System)  for .Net (C#, VB, F# etc.)

## MultiHash

## MultiAddress

## Base58

Most binary data (objects) in IPFS is represented as a [Base-58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58) string; the BitCoin alphabet is used.

> Base58 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes used to represent large integers as alphanumeric text. It is similar to Base64 but has been modified to avoid both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which might look ambiguous when printed. It is therefore designed for human users who manually enter the data, copying from some visual source, but also allows easy copy and paste because a double-click will usually select the whole string.
